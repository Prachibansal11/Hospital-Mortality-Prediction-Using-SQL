# 🏥 Hospital Mortality Analysis Dashboard

A data analysis project aimed at uncovering patterns and insights related to in-hospital mortality using **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Tableau**.

---

## 📌 Business Problem

Healthcare professionals are trying to identify the **main causes of in-hospital mortality** for admitted patients.  
By understanding these causes early, professionals can develop **targeted interventions** and implement **evidence-based protocols** to reduce preventable deaths.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- 📊 **Excel** – Data import, initial cleaning
- 🗄️ **MySQL** – Data querying and analysis
- 📈 **Tableau** – Interactive dashboard creation

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from public health data repositories and imported into **Excel** for initial cleaning before being transferred to **MySQL** for deeper analysis.

---

## 🚀 My Approach to Solving the Problem

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Cleaned the raw dataset in Excel.
   - Uploaded and structured the data in MySQL.
  
2. **SQL Analysis**
   - Conducted queries to analyze attributes such as:
     - Age
     - Ethnicity
     - Gender
     - Weight & BMI
     - Heart Rate
     - ICU Admit Source & Type
     - Comorbidities
     - ICU Length of Stay

3. **Insights Extraction**
   - Identified patterns and trends from the SQL outputs.
  
4. **Dashboard Design**
   - Created an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to visualize findings in a meaningful, user-friendly manner.
